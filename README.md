## üîó Summary

The project is a Social Media Trend Analysis Tool using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). It fetches trending tweets, extracts keywords, stores embeddings in a vector store, and answers user queries using OpenAI.

Key components:

Tweet Ingestion: Tweets are fetched using the Twitter API with keyword-based search or mocked for fallback.

Trend Detection: Uses nltk and RAKE for keyword extraction to identify trending phrases/topics.

Vector Store: Embeds tweets using SentenceTransformer and stores them in a ChromaDB in-memory vector store.

Query & Retrieval: A user query is embedded and matched against stored vectors to retrieve relevant tweets.

Answer Generation (RAG): The most relevant tweets are passed as context to OpenAI to generate a meaningful, contextual answer.

User Interface: Streamlit is used for a clean UI to input queries, show trends, and display responses.
